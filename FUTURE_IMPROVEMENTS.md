# Future Improvements

This document contains notes about potential improvements that were considered but not implemented for this test assignment.

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching System (Removed)

A caching system was implemented but removed as it was overkill for this test assignment. The implementation included:

- **Triangle Cache**: Cached individual triangle calculations to avoid recalculating the same triangles
- **Dimension Cache**: Cached width and length calculations for each wall-corner combination
- **Cache Key Generation**: Smart key generation based on wall coordinates and corner IDs
- **Memory Management**: `clearCache()` method for memory cleanup

**Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Cache maps for storing results
private static triangleCache = new Map<string, TriangleResult | null>()
private static dimensionCache = new Map<string, DimensionResult>()

// Cache key generation
private static createTriangleCacheKey(wallPoint: Point, cornerPoint: Point, wallLine: Line): string {
  return `${wallPoint.x},${wallPoint.y}-${cornerPoint.x},${cornerPoint.y}-${wallLine.start.x},${wallLine.start.y}-${wallLine.end.x},${wallLine.end.y}`
}

private static createDimensionCacheKey(wall: Line, corners: Corner[], type: 'width' | 'length'): string {
  const cornerIds = corners.map(c => c.id).sort().join(',')
  return `${type}-${wall.start.x},${wall.start.y}-${wall.end.x},${wall.end.y}-${cornerIds}`
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Avoids recalculating the same triangles multiple times
- Significant performance improvement for complex room shapes
- Useful for real-time applications with frequent dimension calculations

**When to Consider:**

- Large room shapes with many corners
- Real-time applications requiring frequent recalculations
- Performance-critical scenarios

## Other Potential Improvements

### 1. Unit Testing

- Add comprehensive unit tests for geometry calculations
- Test triangle calculations with various room shapes
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 2. Error Handling

- Add validation for invalid room data
- Handle edge cases like degenerate triangles
- Add proper error messages and logging

### 3. Visualization Enhancements

- Add animation for dimension changes
- Show calculation steps visually
- Add interactive wall selection

### 4. Code Organization

- Split large components into smaller, focused components
- Add more comprehensive TypeScript types
- Implement proper state management for larger applications

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- Add performance metrics for calculations
- Monitor memory usage
- Profile calculation bottlenecks

## Notes

- The current implementation prioritizes simplicity and clarity over performance
- All improvements should be benchmarked before implementation
- Consider the trade-off between complexity and performance gains
